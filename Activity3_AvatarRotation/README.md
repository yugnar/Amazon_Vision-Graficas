# Activity 3

Student: Rafael Rojas

Comments: Had some trouble with hiding the controls and not disabling the rotation function, the example on threejs.org and documentation seemed somewhat inconsistent in functionality for that particular issue. As of now, default control is visible but general functionality is 100% complete.
